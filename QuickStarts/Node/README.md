# Node QuickStart Sample

## Description
This repository contains a very simple Node application that implements the Microsoft Graph Security API.

### Examples Provided
- GET all alerts
- GET and PATCH one alert
- GET all secure scores
- GET all TI Indicators
- GET, PATCH, and DELETE one TI indicator
- CREATE, PATCH and DELETE multiple TI indicators
- DELETE multiple TI indicators by External IDs
> > - PATCH and DELETE bulk TI indicators currently support only `Azure Sentinel` **targetProduct**.
> > - **targetProduct** and **expirationDateTime** are required for PATCH and DELETE bulk methods.

## App Registration
To configure the sample, you'll need to register a new application in the Microsoft [Application Registration Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908).
Follow these steps to register a new application:
1. Sign in to the [Application Registration Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) using either your personal or work or school account.

2. Choose **New registration**.

3. Enter an application name, and choose **Register**.

4. Next you'll see the overview page for your app. Copy and save the **Application Id** field. You will need it later to complete the configuration process.

5. Under **Certificates & secrets**, choose **New client secret** and add a quick description. A new secret will be displayed in the **Value** column. Copy this password. You will need it later to complete the configuration process and it will not be shown again.

6. Under **API permissions**, choose **Add a permission > Microsoft Graph**.

1. Under **Application Permissions**, add the permissions/scopes required for the sample. This sample requires **ThreatIndicators.ReadWrite.OwnedBy**.
    >Note: See the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) for more information about Graph's permission model.

As the final step in configuring the script, modify the config.py file in the root folder of your cloned repo.

Update the variables in app.js as follows:
```
const appId = '<enter your application/client ID>';
const appSecret = '<enter your application/client secret>';
const tenantId = '<enter your tenant ID>';
```
Once changes are complete, save the file. After you've completed these steps and have received [admin consent](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/python-security-rest-sample#Get-Admin-consent-to-view-Security-data) for your app, you'll be able to run the app.js sample as covered below.

### Notes:
- The "etc" folder has non-essential code for the sample
- The "run" function in app.js is the entry point for the application
- All code that interacts with the API is contained inside GraphController.js

## Instructions
1) Clone this repository
2) Register an application using the steps above
3) Execute "npm i" to install "request" and "request-promise"
4) Provide you application details in the config.js file
5) Execute "node app.js" to start the server
